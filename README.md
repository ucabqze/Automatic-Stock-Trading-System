“Final Strategy” File: If you want to test our final strategy, you can Open R and change the working directory to the ‘FinalStrategy’ directory and run source(‘main.r’). The parameters for indicators can be changed in ‘example_strategies.r’. 

If you want to test our sub strategies, you need to change the code in main.r from strategy <- "team8" to strategy <- "subStrategy_1” or strategy <- "subStrategy_2”. (“subStrategy_1” is our trend following strategy and “subStrategy_2” is our mean reversion strategy)
